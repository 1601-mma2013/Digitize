# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope
1. Objectives

To create a Virtual Fitting Room app. It enables users to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically.

  *Problem that customers facing in traditional boutique shop:*

- Take time to choose/change the clothes.
- Queue up to try the new clothes.
- Choose for suitable size of the clothes.

### b. Audit
Existing work and product

- N-show Virtual Dressing Room: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VUkMahcLI

1. Competitors 

   - Traditional boutique shop.
   - Online clothes store.

2. Relevant technologies 

   - Kinect
   - Depth sensing camera
   - Webcam

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Product vision and constraints
1. constraints 
   - viable technologies: unadvanced depth sensing camera/webcam.
   - cost: insufficient cost for multiple assets.


2. opportunities 
   1. In spite of the obstacles we have this project has strength from

       a) Help increase purchase intent.

       b) Save time of trying clothes.

       c) Allow users to share images of themselves with friends through social apps

   2. Persisting problem

       a) Need a certain amount of cost for frequently update clothes data & maintenance fees.
